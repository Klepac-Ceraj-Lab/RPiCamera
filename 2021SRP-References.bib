abstract = {The development of timelapse videos for the investigation of growing microbial colonies has gained increasing interest due to its low cost and complexity implementation. In the present study, a simple experimental setup is proposed for periodic snapshot acquisition of a petri dish cultivating a fungus of the genus Candida SPP, thus creating a timelapse video. A computational algorithm, based on image processing techniques is proposed for estimating the microbial population and for extracting the experimental population curves, showing the time evolution of the population of microbes at any region of the dish. Likewise, a novel mathematical population evolution modeling approach is reported, which is based on the logistic function (LF). Parameter estimation of the aforementioned model is described and visually assessed, in comparison with the conventional and widely-used LF method. The effect of the image analysis parameterization is also highlighted. Our experiments take into account different area sizes, i.e., the number of pixels in the neighborhood, to generate population curves and calculate the model parameters. Our results reveal that, as the size of the area increases, the curve becomes smoother, the signal-to-noise-ratio increases and the estimation of model parameters becomes more accurate.},

          Capturing microbial growth on a macroscopic scale is of great importance to further our understanding of microbial life. However, methods for imaging microbial life on a scale of millimeters to centimeters are often limited by designs that have poor environmental control, resulting in dehydration of the agar plate within just a few days. Here, we created MOCHA (

          mber), a simple but effective chamber that allows users to study microbial growth for extended periods (weeks) in a stable environment. Agar hydration is maintained with a double-decker design, in which two glass petri dishes are connected by a wick, allowing the lower plate to keep the upper plate hydrated. This flexible chamber allows the observation of a variety of microbiological phenomena, such as the growth and development of single bacterial and fungal colonies, interspecies interactions, swarming motility, and pellicle formation.
        
        
          IMPORTANCE
          Detailed study of microbial life on the colony scale of millimeters to centimeters has been lagging considerably behind microscopic inspection of microbes. One major reason for this is the lack of inexpensive instrumentation that can reproducibly capture images in a controlled environment. In this study, we present the design and use of a unique chamber that was used to produce several time-lapse movies that aimed to capture the diversity of microbial colony phenotypes over long periods.},
